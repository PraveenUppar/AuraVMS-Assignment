Tech stack

- Python has excellent document parsing libraries
- FastAPI forces clean structure (not a spaghetti Flask app)
- JSON storage removes DB complexity (and is allowed)
- Email + SMTP is easiest in Python
- Testing is natural with pytest

Decisions

- No DB
- No Auth
- Easy parsing
- Email service

Build order:

- Parser module 
- State machine logic
- JSON storage
- FastAPI routes (upload, approve, reject)
- Email service
- Basic auth
- Frontend templates
- Tests
- Deployment
- README
