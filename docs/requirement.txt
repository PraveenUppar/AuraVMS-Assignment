Core functionality
 
1. Upload a document 

2. Parse the document - Extract the content(title + Heading + content) + image 
- Accept a .docx .txt or .md file.
(.txt and .md — built-in Python)
- Treat the first line as the title, the rest as the content.
- if the first line looks like ![caption](image.png) or a URL, treat it as an optional image reference

3. Upload the content/post to the admin
- Store submissions in‑memory or in a simple JSON file; no heavy database required.

4. Admin can approve or reject the content 
- When a post is submitted, send an email (you can use Gmail smtp) to a hard‑coded manager address with the title, a snippet of content (first 100 chars), and a link to approve/reject.
- Include two links in the email (e.g., http://localhost:8000/approve?post_id=123 and .../reject?...) that update the post status to approved or rejected.
- On the frontend, show a simple list of pending posts and allow the admin to click approve/reject to update the status.

5. Display approved posts
- Create a public page (e.g., /posts) that lists all approved posts with title, content, and image (if present).

Non‑functional expectations

- Clear module split (upload/parser vs. workflow vs. emailer).
- Basic error handling (invalid file type, missing title, email config missing).
- At least one unit test for the parser and one for the state transition logic.​
- README with setup steps

Deliverables
- Hosted app with the UI
- 2 login ids, one for manager, one for blog writer
- Github repo with the code
- README.md as described.

Evaluation rubric (weights)
- Image extraction & upload (10%): Extracts the image provided by user properly. You can make it url based, or docx embedded image.
- Parsing & upload correctness (20%): Extracts title/content reliably; handles edge cases (empty file, missing title).
- User experience (10%): Ease of using your tool, its robustness, and clean, minimalist design.
- Workflow state & logic (15%): Pending → approved/rejected transitions work; no accidental overwrites.
- Email notification (20%): Email is triggered on submit; contains correct info and actionable links (or clear log if SMTP is skipped).
- Deadline adherence (10%): users who submit complete, functioning project before the deadline.
- Code quality & structure (10%): Separation of concerns; readable naming; not a monolithic script.
- Tests & docs (5%): At least one test; README explains setup and decisions.
